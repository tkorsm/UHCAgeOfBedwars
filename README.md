# Ultra Hardcore Age of Bedwars

## 1 - Overview

UHC Age of Bedwars is a unique take on a number of different classic gamemodes, such as: Team Deathmatch, Ultra Hardcore, and Bedwars.

The gamemode is a two-team deathmatch that takes place within a survival Minecraft world, where the goal is to eliminate all players on the opposing team. Players start off with a bed, and can place it during any point in the match. If the player dies and they have not placed their bed or it has been destroyed, they are eliminated from the game.

In addition, the game has many modifications to it that make the gamemode more unforgiving. Health regeneration speed and hunger replenishment is decreased dramatically.

To balance out the durability of playermade bases, craftable blocks (Wood Planks, Material Blocks) or Cobblestone will have exponentially increased Hardness and Blast Resistance values. The Material Blocks in particular will also produce 9 blocks instead of 1, but will not drop if destroyed. For detailed values go to [TBA].
