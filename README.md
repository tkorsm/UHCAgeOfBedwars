# Ultra Hardcore Age of Bedwars

## 1 - Overview

UHC Age of Bedwars is a unique take on a number of different classic gamemodes, such as: Team Deathmatch, Ultra Hardcore, and Bedwars.

The gamemode is a two-team deathmatch that takes place within a survival Minecraft world. Players start off with a bed, and can place it during any point in the match. Each bed is tied the player who placed it, if the player dies and they have not placed their bed or it has been destroyed, they are eliminated from the game. Beds are banned from crafting.

In addition, the game has many modifications to it that make the gamemode more unforgiving. Natural Health Regeneration and Hunger are nerfed dramatically. There will be a 2 minute grace period at the start of the game, during this time: Health Regeneration is normal, Hunger will not deplete, dying without placing a bed will respawn you around 0, 0.

To balance out the durability of playermade bases, some blocks will have increased/decreased Hardness and Blast Resistance values. The Material Blocks in particular will also produce 9 blocks instead of 1, but will not drop if destroyed. (See 2B)

The game awards victory to the team who eliminates all players on the opposing team. The intended game length is 30 minutes.
